| POST   | `/activities/{activity_name}/signup?email=student@mergington.edu` | Sign up for an activity                                             |
| DELETE | `/activities/{activity_name}/signup?email=student@mergington.edu` | Unregister a student from an activity                               |

## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

All data is stored in memory, which means data will be reset when the server restarts.

Registration requires a valid email address, rejects duplicate registrations, and rejects activities that have reached their maximum participant limit.
